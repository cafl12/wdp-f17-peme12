    <h1>"Hello World!"<1>
    <h2> "A place I would like to visit"<h2>
    <p>If i could go anywhere to in the world i would go to Mexcio and visit my grandmother. I would see my family and spend all day with them. Life there is so diffrent from here, its just so simple. Whenever i think of going to Mexcio with my family i think of a care free life when things are simple and easy.<p>
    <h2>"A person i admire"<h2>
    <br>
    <p> A person i truly admire is my old baseball coach. I've known the man for 14 years. He's taught me so much than just how to hit a curveball. He's showed me how to be a man of Christ and what it means to bring glory to God. Ive had this man in my life for the last 14 years, and i consider him like a second father.<p>
