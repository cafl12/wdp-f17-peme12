    <p>If i could go anywhere to in the world i would go to Mexcio and visit my grandmother. I would see my family and spend all day with them. Life there is so diffrent from here, its just so simple. Whenever i think of going to Mexcio with my family i think of a care free life when things are simple and easy.<p>

    <br>
    <p> A person i truly admire is my old baseball coach. I've known the man for 14 years. He's taught me so much than just how to hit a curveball. He's showed me how to be a man of Christ and what it means to bring glory to God. Ive had this man in my life for the last 14 years, and i consider him like a second father.<p>

    <h2> "Favortie Animal"<h2>
    <a href="project3.html"> <p> My favorite animal by far has to be the wolf. Wolves in my mind are so awesome. I like the idea of being a lone wolf. That Idea of just relaying on yourself is such a realsitc view of the world. That if you want something done right, just do it yourself. And not needing anyone to help out when things get tough./>
